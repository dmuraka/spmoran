# Spatial regression using the spmoran package: Boston house price data examples
This page demonstrates how to use "spmoran", an R package estimating Moran eigenvector-based spatial regression models. Currently, this package implements basic spatial regression models and extensions, including spatially and non-spatially varying coefficient model, models with group effects, spatial unconditional quantile regression model, and low rank spatial econometric models. All these models are estimated computationally efficiently.
