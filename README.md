# Spatial regression using the spmoran package: Boston house price data examples
This page demonstrates how to use the spmoran package. This package estimates spatial additive mixed models and other spatial regression models for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. Moran eigenvectors are used to an approximate spatial Gaussian process modeling which is interpretable in terms of the Moran coefficient. Currently, this package implements basic spatial regression models and extensions, including spatially and non-spatially varying coefficient model, models with group effects, spatial unconditional quantile regression model, and low rank spatial econometric models. All these models are estimated computationally efficiently. For details see Murakami (2020) <arXiv:1703.04467>.
